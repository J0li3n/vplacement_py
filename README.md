# vplacement_py

This project contains python code to access the Spoonacular API and to transform a recipe into a vegetarian one. The end result can be viewed at https://vplacement.netlify.app/. You can simply paste the URL of your favorite recipe and find a similar vegetarian one, paste e.g. https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/240708/broccoli-and-chicken-stir-fry/
