# vplacement_py

This project contains python code to access the Spoonacular API and to transform a recipe into a vegetarian one. The end result cannot be viewed at anymore, because the free Heroku server on which the Python Flask API was deployed is not available since December 2022. Before, you could simply paste the URL of your favorite recipe and find a similar vegetarian one, paste e.g. https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/chicken-and-broccoli-stir-fry-recipe-1942670
